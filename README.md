### Blender Clipboard to Scene


---

**It doesn't work with version 2.93 and higher**  
(I tested it on 2.91 and 2.83)  
there is a problem importing about Pillow module 

---

## How to Install:  

1. Add [PIL or pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to your Blender folder here: `C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 2.91\2.91\python\lib` or in `\scripts\modules`     
2. go to Edit-> Prefrences -> Add-ons and click install then select the `add image.py` file  
3. well, first you need to download all of those things
